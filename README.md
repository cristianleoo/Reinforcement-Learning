# Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning Tutorials repository. This repository contains the source code for a series of reinforcement learning tutorials, each associated with a Medium article. The tutorials cover a range of topics in reinforcement learning, from the basics to more advanced techniques.

## Repository Structure

Each tutorial is contained in its own directory, which includes the source code, a Jupyter notebook, and a link to the associated Medium article.

## Tutorial 1: GridWorld

The first tutorial introduces the concept of reinforcement learning through a simple GridWorld environment. The agent learns to navigate a grid, avoiding obstacles and reaching a goal.

- Jupyter Notebook: `demo.ipynb`
- Medium Article: [https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-101-building-a-rl-agent-0431984ba178#f7b6]

## Tutorial 2: Q-Learning

The second tutorial introduces the implementation of the Q-Learning algorithm.
In this tutorial we increase the complexity of the GridWorld environment, adding random obstacles.

- Python File `main.py`

## Installation

To run the tutorials, you will need Python 3.6 or later. The required Python packages can be installed with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run a tutorial, navigate to its directory and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook gridworld.ipynb
```
